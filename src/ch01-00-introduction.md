# Introduction

This book covers [Rain's](https://github.com/sunshowers) opinions about how to organize and manage Rust CLI applications.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

Issues containing recommendations and PRs are welcome! However, I get to make the final call: if your opinions diverge from mine, you're welcome to fork this project.
