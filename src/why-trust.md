# Why trust me?

I'm a reasonably proficient Rust developer, and have been using Rust professionally full-time since early 2017. I've also released the open source Rust CLI tools [cargo-hakari](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-hakari) and [cargo-search2](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-search2), with more in development.

The list of recommendations is based on what I personally value most; however, most of these involve tradeoffs along a [Pareto front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency). Wherever possible, I provide a list of benefits and costs, and alternatives, to help you make an informed decision.
